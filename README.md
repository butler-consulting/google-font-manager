Google Font Manager
=========

Easily add and manage Google fonts to your WordPress website. With multiple use options, this plugin is perfect for programmers, designers and general users alike.

**The Google Font Manager plugin was written to help you quickly and easily add Google fonts to your WordPress website. Designed for both regular and advanced WordPress users in mind.** 

With minimal overhead, it will not add any unnecessary "bloat" to your site, adding only what you need according to your settings. You can use this plugin to simply add Google fonts to your site and reference them in your own custom style sheets (if you are using a child theme). Or, if you are not coding your own theme, there are a variety of ways you can use the built-in functions of WordPress to make use of the fonts you add. Either way, it provides the perfect solution for adding Google fonts to your website.

**Some of the features:**

* Add as many Google Fonts as you want to your site
* Full integration with Google Fonts API
* Automatically adds fonts to Visual Editor (tinyMCE)
* Optionally adds "Web Safe Fonts" to Visual Editor 
* Customize style sheet to override theme default
